# SNS Plot RL and DRL
Use of Seaborn library to plot episodic reward and other data using tensorboard logs for using in reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning experiments. 

# Step for plot
## 1) Load all the load files 
Load all files you want to plot using sns_plot_rl_drl. You can do so by placing the relevent tensorboard logs into log folder.
## 2) Change the code to plot your needed output
The deafult code contains lines to plot episodic reward and one another parameter for the relevent experiment.
